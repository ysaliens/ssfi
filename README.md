### Super Simple File Indexer (SSFI)
A multi-threaded word frequency counter written in C++. SSFI recursively scans a given directory for files ending in .txt. It then queues those files to be processed by worker threads. Worker threads will pick up files from the queue and scan them, counting how many occurences of each word they see. Once complete, the program prints the top 10 words and their counts
